			<br><br>Welcome to our humble home! Here you'll find all manner of strange creatures eager to introduce themselves. While our little cabal is small in numbers at the moment, we anticipate new members to join us soon! Hey- why don't you sign up? You look like you'd fit right in!

			<span style="font-size:25px; color:#0092B2; font-family: super-dessert;">Meet Pablo!</span><br>
			The elder brother of Dougie, Pablo is a stern character. Sometimes cranky and abrasive, Pablo often gets a bad rap, espeically compared to his energetic little brother. But Pablo's bad moods are just a side effect of some of his greatest strenghts- his immense care for detail and sensitivity to his surroundings. Pablo likes to have everything 'just so', and if he feels something is out of place, he finds it hard to focus on anything else. Wether he's picking up litter on the street, or doing his best to cheer up his brother's frown, Pablo won't rest until he does his part to put the world back as he feels it should be. But keeping the whole world in order is a tall task, and Pablo often forgets to ask for help with his missions. Luckily, his friends are always glad to lend a hand!
			<br>Pablo is glad to see you this fine day!

			Who do you think our next member will be? Could it be you? The critter cabal still has plenty of room in it's cast, and we can't wait to introduce more of our friends to you!
			<br> We've loved getting to know you!
