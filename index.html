			<br><br>Welcome to our humble home! Here you'll find all manner of strange creatures eager to introduce themselves. While our little cabal is small in numbers at the moment, we anticipate new members to join us soon! Hey- why don't you sign up? You look like you'd fit right in!

			<span style="font-size:25px; color:#FF6517; font-family: super-dessert;">Meet Dougie!</span><br>
			Dougie is our resident wise-guy, and the younger brother of Pablo. A great lover of bad puns and interesting facts, people often say their first impression of Dougie was that of a cold and logical smartie. But spending a little time with him you'll quickly realise Dougie is a bright and bubbly character, always glad to stop for a chat. Dougie's friends will be glad to tell you that this smart cookie has a warm and gooey center- in fact Dougie is a very kind and gentle creature! One of his favourite activities is watching bugs go about their little buggie lives, doing little buggy things! Dougie is always glad to make a new friend, and only about 70% of that motive is so he can tell all of his interesting facts and re-used jokes to fresh ears.
			<br>Dougie is so glad to meet you!

			<span style="font-size:25px; color:#0092B2; font-family: super-dessert;">Meet Pablo!</span><br>
			The elder brother of Dougie, Pablo is a stern character. Sometimes cranky and abrasive, Pablo often gets a bad rap, espeically compared to his energetic little brother. But Pablo's bad moods are just a side effect of some of his greatest strenghts- his immense care for detail and sensitivity to his surroundings. Pablo likes to have everything 'just so', and if he feels something is out of place, he finds it hard to focus on anything else. Wether he's picking up litter on the street, or doing his best to cheer up his brother's frown, Pablo won't rest until he does his part to put the world back as he feels it should be. But keeping the whole world in order is a tall task, and Pablo often forgets to ask for help with his missions. Luckily, his friends are always glad to lend a hand!
			<br>Pablo is glad to see you this fine day!

			Who do you think our next member will be? Could it be you? The critter cabal still has plenty of room in it's cast, and we can't wait to introduce more of our friends to you!
			<br> We've loved getting to know you!
