			Dougie is our resident wise-guy, and the younger brother of Pablo. A great lover of bad puns and interesting facts, people often say their first impression of Dougie was that of a cold and logical smartie. But spending a little time with him you'll quickly realise Dougie is a bright and bubbly character, always glad to stop for a chat. Dougie's friends will be glad to tell you that this smart cookie has a warm and gooey center- in fact Dougie is a very kind and gentle creature! One of his favourite activities is watching bugs go about their little buggie lives, doing little buggy things! Dougie is always glad to make a new friend, and only about 70% of that motive is so he can tell all of his interesting facts and re-used jokes to fresh ears.
			<br>Dougie is so glad to meet you!
