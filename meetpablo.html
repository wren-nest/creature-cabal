      <br><br>The elder brother of Dougie, Pablo is a stern character. Sometimes cranky and abrasive, Pablo often gets a bad rap, espeically compared to his energetic little brother. But Pablo's bad moods are just a side effect of some of his greatest strenghts- his immense care for detail and sensitivity to his surroundings. Pablo likes to have everything 'just so', and if he feels something is out of place, he finds it hard to focus on anything else. Wether he's picking up litter on the street, or doing his best to cheer up his brother's frown, Pablo won't rest until he does his part to put the world back as he feels it should be. But keeping the whole world in order is a tall task, and Pablo often forgets to ask for help with his missions. Luckily, his friends are always glad to lend a hand!
			<br>Pablo is glad to see you this fine day!
